### Conclusion

I won't have more time to work on this project, mI finished this competition with a **Median Absolute Error of 0.45729** in the leaderboard which reached me around the 300th place. I learned new skills about `Deep Learning` and it was my first project on Regression with `Deep Learning`. I may come back to this project later to improve my score.
